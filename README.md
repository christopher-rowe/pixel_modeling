# Pixel Modeling
Fitting statistical and machine learning models to image pixels to obtain interesting effects

## Overview
Because digitized images are just arrays of numbers, there are a wide variety of ways to manipulate those numbers and thus manipulate images. Image editing, as in something like Photoshop or Instagram, really just consists of targeted mathematical operations on the numeric arrays underlying any given image. I thought it would be fun to experiment with different approaches to manipulate image pixel values, with a focus on incorporating randomness and utilizing regression algorithms. This repository is intended more as a source of inspiration for further experimentation as opposed to providing nicely packaged functionality, though I have included a a small number of standalone functions.
